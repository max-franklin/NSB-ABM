*MODEL STILL IN DEVELOPMENT*

The NSB-ABM is an agent-based model that serves as a simulation platform for subsistence harvest dynamics on the north slope of Alaska. It integrates landscape drivers (e.g. elevation, precipitation, vegetation), resources (e.g. broad whitefish, caribou, moose), and subsistence users to simulate seasonal summer subsistence activities and harvest at Nuiqsut village. By altering the drivers and behaviors of the model's agents, different scenarios will be tested to determine their impact on subsistence activities and dynamics.
